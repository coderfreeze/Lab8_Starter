Service workers are the means to enable graceful degregation. When we want graceful degregation in our project, we can use service workers.  
Service workers use the cache and return as much information over the network as they can, ensuring the user has some  
access to the app in the event of a network failure. This allows the user to still have basic functionality of the app without internet.
